Provides classes and methods to access dbase III, IV and V format files,
DBF, DBT, NDX and MDX extensions.

All classes and methods are written in pure Java.  

Note:
  "we have not applied for the pure Java test from JavaSoft/Sun"
 

----------------------------------------------------------------------



Four classes of interest:
   1.  dbf - provides methods for accessing the dbase file via Java's 
   RandomAccessFile class.
   2.  server - provides server machine interface via sockets.
   3.  client\dbf - provides methods for accessing remote dbase files
   from a client machine.
   4. ndx - provides methods for accessing dbase NDX files.
   5.  dbfHTML - simple java application to create a HTML report of a
   dbf file.

Other classes of interest:
   1. field - not an interface but a class with which subclasses
   provide strong typing.
   2. charField.
   3. dateField.
   4. logicalField.
   5. memoField.
   6. numField.
   7. floatField.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Other files included:

   1.  Sample Java and NetRexx programs.
   2.  Registration information.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
Known bugs:

  Problem with numeric and date index fields with MDX tags. For the 
  time being, it's best just to use character fields for tags.

  Inspire's jBuilder jit doesn't seem to like the create function.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Installation:

  1. Unzip xdbfj18H.zip into a unique directory.   If you're reading 
  this you have already unzipped.
  2. Add the file xBaseJ.jar to your classpath. 
  3. To test try the dbfShow class against the supplied test.dbf
      -  java dbfShow
      You will be prompted via the FileDialog for the filename.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

java version compiled with:
  JAVA.EXE version "JDK 1.1.7a"

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Caveats:

Program has only been tested on the Intel machine platform 
       (System.getProperty("os.arch").compareTo("x86") == 0) 

Any problems you experience should be reported as soon as possible.

This is not a JDBC/ODBC interface.


----------------------------------------------------------------------

Sample programs:
     Included are two groups of sample programs. Each group contains
     the same three programs

     Java group: 
     1. createDBFS.java - creates the dbfs.dbf database. This dbf 
        is used by the Server class to determine what files are
        available to the client class.
     2. testread.java - will dump a dbf out.
     3. pack.java - will pack a dbf (remove records marked as
        deleted).


     NetRexx group: 
     1. createDBFS.nrx - creates the dbfs.dbf database.  This dbf 
        is used by the Server class to determine what files are
        available to the client class.
     2. testread.nrx - will dump a dbf out.
     3. pack.nrx - will pack a dbf (remove records marked as deleted).
        - NetRexx is a dialect of Java that fully supports the 
          java language.  For more information go to
